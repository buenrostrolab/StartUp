# Getting started in the Buenrostro lab

## Accounts

Some of these things requires other people to take action, but usually you need to send us appropriate username/email accounts.

1. Get access to the cluster resources we use. This may require scheduling an orientation.
2. Get appropriate permissions on the cluster resources; you may have to be added to the right permission groups.
3. Get a username on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and make sure that you're added as a member of the buenrostrolab organization (this requires that you send [Caleb](caleblareau@g.harvard.edu) GitHub username).
4. If you have a .edu email address, add it to your GitHub account and request an [educational start up](https://education.github.com/pack). Git provides a lot of free resources for people with edu email addresses.
5. Get added to our [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel, buenrostrolab. Tell [Caleb](caleblareau@g.harvard.edu) 1) what email address you want to be associated with your Slack account and 2) any special channels (e.g. Immgen) you need to be added to. 
6. Access to dropbox?
7. Access to Google Calendar?
8. Get added to the [Lab](http://buenrostrolab.github.io) webpage.
